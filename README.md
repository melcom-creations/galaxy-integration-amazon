## 📦 Installation

### 🔄 Automatic Installation with Plugin Updater (Recommended)

Use the [melcom GOG Galaxy Plugin Updater](https://github.com/melcom-creations/galaxy-integrations-64bit/tree/main/tools/melcom-galaxy_plugin_updater) to install or update the integration.

1. Download and extract the Plugin Updater.
2. Double-click `update-plugins.bat`.
3. Select your preferred language and follow the displayed instructions.

### 📂 Manual Installation

1. Close GOG Galaxy completely, including the system tray application.
2. Download the [latest release package](https://github.com/melcom-creations/galaxy-integration-amazon/releases/latest).
3. Extract the plugin folder from the ZIP archive into:

   ```text
   %localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\
   ```

Place `manifest.json` directly inside this folder, without an extra nested plugin folder:

```text
%localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\amazon_c2cd2e29-8b02-35a9-86fc-3faf90255857\
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not place backup copies of this plugin inside the `plugins\installed` directory. GOG Galaxy scans every folder inside this directory during startup, so duplicate plugin folders can cause GUID conflicts or load an outdated version.

**Next step:** Continue with [First Start and Initial Sync](#-first-start-and-initial-sync).

## 🚀 First Start and Initial Sync

For the first synchronization after installing or updating the plugin:

1. Start the Amazon Games app and keep it open.
2. Start GOG Galaxy.
3. Connect the Amazon Games integration through **Settings -> Integrations** if necessary.
4. Open the account menu in the top-right corner and select **Sync integrations**.
5. Wait until the synchronization has finished.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Restart Galaxy and the store app and try one synchronization. If the problem remains, collect a fresh log. A database reset is not required for this.

### 🧪 Create a Fresh Diagnostic Log

1. Close GOG Galaxy completely, including the system tray application.
2. Open `%ProgramData%\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\`. Move the existing `plugin-amazon-c2cd2e29-8b02-35a9-86fc-3faf90255857.log` to a backup folder outside this directory, if present. Leave other logs in place.
3. Start the Amazon Games app. Start Galaxy, reproduce the problem once, then close Galaxy completely to finish writing the log.
4. Send the newly created plugin log, not the entire folder. Include the plugin and Galaxy versions, your steps, the expected and actual result, and whether the problem can be reproduced.

See [Support & Feedback](#-support--feedback) for contact options.

### 🔄 Reset Plugin Storage (Last Resort)

Use this only if restarting and synchronizing do not help, or when requested for troubleshooting. Cached library data and local playtime may be lost; signing in again may be required. Keep the backup.

1. Close GOG Galaxy completely, including the system tray application.
2. Open `%ProgramData%\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\plugins\`.
3. Find the active `amazon_...-storage.db` file for your Galaxy account. If unsure which file is correct, stop. Leave other integrations' databases unchanged.
4. Append `.old` to its name. If that backup already exists, use an unused suffix; never overwrite it.
5. Start the Amazon Games app. Start Galaxy, reconnect if necessary, and select **Sync integrations** once. Wait until it finishes.

To undo: close Galaxy, rename the new database to an unused backup name, then restore the saved database's original name. Never restore it while Galaxy is running.

## ❤️ Special Thanks

I want to take a moment to thank the people who kept me going during this intense development phase:

* A huge thank you to my friend [**Hustlefan**](https://www.gog.com/u/Hustlefan). Over the past few days, you've been much more than just moral support. You gave me the encouragement I needed, patiently put up with all my Discord spam, and helped beta test the plugins. I'm really happy that you're pleased with the results. Thanks so much for all your support, my friend.

* And a big thank you to my girlfriend [**Florence H.** (fl0H0815)](https://www.gog.com/u/Florence_Heart). While she was enjoying the good life at her parents' place - complete with air conditioning and a huge swimming pool - she kept my spirits up by sending me photos of herself, her friends, her parents, and even her parents' dog. She reminded me that there's a wonderful world outside of a code editor every now and then... 🙈

  *Now that's what I call real support.* ❤️

Thank you both for having my back!
